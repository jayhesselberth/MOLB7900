# Densitometry {#protein-gels}

A recurrent principle in molecular biology is to seprate molecules by molecular mass using gel electrophoresis, more specifically Western bloting for protein analsis. This is very common and we will cover methods to perform analysis and quantification of these experiments using densitometry methods (figure from Wikipedia).
