# RNA-protein interaction {#rna-clip}

RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) regulate each step in the life of an mRNA. This includes key decisions like RNA splicing, translation, and degradation. We will cover methods that identify RBP-RNA interactions and the considerations in analyzing and interpreting these data (figure from Wikipedia).
