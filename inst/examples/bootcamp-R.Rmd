# R and RStudio {#bootcamp-r}

Students will learn to use [Rstudio](https://www.rstudio.com/), which is an integrated development environment that makes it way easier to code in R. Within Rstudio, students will use [Rmarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) to produce high-quality reports, presentations, and documents in a highly reproducible manner. Students will become fluent in importing, processing, and transforming data using a collection of R packages designed for data science [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/).

After achieving exellence in basic data handling, students will be introduced to a broad range of commonly used statistical tests and an underlying conceptual framework for deciding the appropriate statistical test. We will emphasize concepts unique to genomic/big data. These statistical concepts and tests will be revisited during applied sections of the course in which specific technology and data are introduced and re-analyzed.

__After this section, students will be able to import, process, transform, visualize data; use statistical tests to analyze basic tabular data; genarate html/pdf reports of their work.__
