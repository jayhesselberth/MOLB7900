# Welcome {-}

Informatics and Statistics for Molecular Biology (MOLB 7900) is offered at the University of Colorado School of Medicine and teaches students how to design and analyze common molecular biology experiments.

The course begins with a __Bootcamp__ that introduces core programming concepts in the Unix shell, R, and Python.

Following the Bootcamp, the course has four main components:

* A __DNA Block__ that covers chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing, motif finding and analysis, and variant calling.

* An __RNA Block__ that covers quantitative PCR, RNA-sequencing, and RNA-protein interactions.

* A __Protein Block__ that covers mass spectrometry, densitometry, and protein localization.
