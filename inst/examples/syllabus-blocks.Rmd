# Blocks {#syllabus-blocks}

## Bootcamp

This 4 week block is designed to get students familiar with and bring them up to speed on using software for shell programming and data analysis with R and Python. We also establish accounts on Github for problem set submission. __In future blocks, students will build upon the statistical and computational foundations they acquire in the bootcamp and combine it with domain-specific knowledge of specific experiment addressing each major step in the central dogma.__

### Shell programming

Students will become familiar with the operating in the Shell, which is closely related to command-line/terminal. The Shell is a program which runs other programs rather than doing calculations itself. Bash is the default shell on most modern implementations of Unix, Mac, and in most packages that provide Unix-like tools for Windows.

__After this section, students will be able to navigate directories, create an organized directory structure for a project, and install and run software.__
	
### R Studio

Students will learn to use [Rstudio](https://www.rstudio.com/), which is an integrated development environment that makes it way easier to code in R. Within Rstudio, students will use [Rmarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) to produce high-quality reports, presentations, and documents in a highly reproducible manner. Students will become fluent in importing, processing, and transforming data using a collection of R packages designed for data science [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/).

```

After achieving exellence in basic data handling, students will be introduced to a broad range of commonly used statistical tests and an underlying conceptual framework for deciding the appropriate statistical test. We will emphasize concepts unique to genomic/big data. These statistical concepts and tests will be revisited during applied sections of the course in which specific technology and data are introduced and re-analyzed.

__After this section, students will be able to import, process, transform, visualize data; use statistical tests to analyze basic tabular data; genarate html/pdf reports of their work.__

### Integration with Git

Modern scientists need to write code as part of their research. This code needs to be documented just as bench experiments need to be logged in a lab notebook. Version control systems like [Git](https://git-scm.com), and online hosting site, [GitHub](https://github.com), are critical tools to address these important issues. These tools allow students to track iterative changes made to their code, revert to a specific previous version, and share their code with the broader scientific community. Altogether these tools are a cornerstone of reproducible research practices that is conveniently integrated within Rstudio and Rmarkdown.

__After this section, students will be able to use git within Rstudio to easily version and share their code. They will be expected to turn in assignments using git in Rstudio.__

### Python

[Python](https://www.python.org/) is an easy to learn language that combines the flexibility of bash along with the conveniences of higher level languages like R. This useful for solving problems for which software does not exist, which is important for students to learn in order to anticipate unmet needs and data from new technologies/assays. Many tools for the analysis of modern datasets are available as python packages, allowing the incorporation of pre-built analysis tools within custom, made-from-scratch, code. Furthermore, python's suitability as a scripting language makes it a natural fit for APIs of other common analysis tools.  For example, image analysis pipelines can be constructed in [Fiji](https://imagej.net/Jython_Scripting), allowing the batch processing of many files at once.  

__After this section, students will be able to write basic software and scripts that will enable them to derive meaning from the large datasets typical of modern biology.__ 

## DNA

This 3 week section covers specific experiments performed on DNA sequences and the types of molecular insights they can provide. 

### Chromatin accessibility

We will cover different experimental techniques to study chromatin accesibility, how they relate to each other, their biological implications, and important data analysis considerations (figure from https://doi.org/10.1186/1756-8935-7-33). 

__Statistical/Computational concepts: Poisson distribution and genomic intervals.__

```

### Motif finding

Sequence elements determine the specificity of many DNA regulatory mechanisms. We will cover key principles and considerations for the discovery of these regulatory motifs from large sets DNA sequences (figure from Wikipedia).

__Statistical/Computational concepts: Position weight matrices, markov models, foreground vs background sequences, expectation maximization, and gibbs sampling.__

```

### Variant Calling

Reliable identification and interprtation of DNA variation is important to advance our understanding of the genetic basis of disease. Here we will cover methods and considerations in calling different types of DNA variants from DNA sequence data (figure from https://doi.org/10.1093/gigascience/gix091). 

__Statistical/Computational concepts: Scripting and binomial distribution.__

## RNA

This 3 week section covers specific experiments performed on RNA sequences, protein-RNA interactionsand the types of molecular insights they can provide. 

### Quantitative PCR

This is one of the most commonly used (and abused) techniques to measure the relative expression levels of specific RNAs. We will cover common pitfalls and important data analysis considerations (figure from Wikipedia).  

__Statistical/Computational concepts: Mean, variance, T-test, and ANOVA models.__

### RNA-seq

A major breakthrough in the last decade has been the introduction of RNA-sequencing, which has allowed us to identify and count the sequences of all RNAs in a biological sample. We will cover the basic principles and most common RNA-seq experimental designs and appropriate analysis methods and considerations (figure from Wikipedia).

__Statistical/Computational concepts: Negative binomial distribution and general linear models.__

### RNA-protein interaction (CLIP)

RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) regulate each step in the life of an mRNA. This includes key decisions like RNA splicing, translation, and degradation. We will cover methods that identify RBP-RNA interactions and the considerations in analyzing and interpreting these data (figure from Wikipedia).

### Densitometry

A recurrent principle in molecular biology is to seprate molecules by molecular mass using gel electrophoresis, more specifically Western bloting for protein analsis. This is very common and we will cover methods to perform analysis and quantification of these experiments using densitometry methods (figure from Wikipedia).
