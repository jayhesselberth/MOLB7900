# Block 3: RNA {#block-rna}

This 3 week section covers specific experiments performed on RNA sequences, protein-RNA interactionsand the types of molecular insights they can provide. 


## Week 4: Quantitative PCR

This is one of the most commonly used (and abused) techniques to measure the relative expression levels of specific RNAs. We will cover common pitfalls and important data analysis considerations (figure from Wikipedia).

## Week 5: RNA-seq

A major breakthrough in the last decade has been the introduction of RNA-sequencing, which has allowed us to identify and count the sequences of all RNAs in a biological sample. We will cover the basic principles and most common RNA-seq experimental designs and appropriate analysis methods and considerations (figure from Wikipedia).

## Week 6: RNA-protein interaction (CLIP)

RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) regulate each step in the life of an mRNA. This includes key decisions like RNA splicing, translation, and degradation. We will cover methods that identify RBP-RNA interactions and the considerations in analyzing and interpreting these data (figure from Wikipedia).
