# Block 2: DNA {#block-dna}

This 3 week section covers specific experiments performed on DNA sequences and the types of molecular insights they can provide. 

## Week 1: Chromatin accessibility

We will cover different experimental techniques to study chromatin accesibility, how they relate to each other, their biological implications, and important data analysis considerations (figure from https://doi.org/10.1186/1756-8935-7-33).

## Week 2: Motif finding

Sequence elements determine the specificity of many DNA regulatory mechanisms. We will cover key principles and considerations for the discovery of these regulatory motifs from large sets DNA sequences (figure from Wikipedia).

## Week 3: Variant Calling

Reliable identification and interprtation of DNA variation is important to advance our understanding of the genetic basis of disease. Here we will cover methods and considerations in calling different types of DNA variants from DNA sequence data (figure from https://doi.org/10.1093/gigascience/gix091).
